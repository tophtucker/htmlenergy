        <h1>Dear New York,</h1>
        <p>Toph, having just moved (back) to Boston, has been worried (only a little) about what sort of HTML Energy heâ€™d find here, and is grateful for this chance to bolster his faith in the future.</p>
        <p>He is especially grateful to Leslie for feeling the <em>park</em> energy!</p>
        <p>Dri, about to leave Boston & just reconnecting with HTML, is very grateful to have found HTML Energy today!</p>
        <p>Katherine, new to Boston and loving it, is feeling HTML Energy in this Tatte tonight.</p>
        <p>Katy is soaking up the html energy, having recently returned to Boston, which seems to have a lot of latent html energy and ~vibes~</p>
        <p>Alicia, saying goodbye to boston and loving it more each day is really vibing with the corn today.</p>
        <p>Leslie! Feeling a lot of ~~HTML energy~~ from the crew. <3 All the love.</p>
        <footer>    
            <p>With <span class="lots">lots</span> of love,</p>
            <p>Boston</p>
